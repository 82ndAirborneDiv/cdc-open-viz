## Data Formatting

The data that you are mapping needs to be formatted in a specific way where there is one column for each row that represents the state or city for the rest of the data on that row. There needs to be an additional column that represents the data you are trying to display on the map. This can be categorical or numerical data. You will specifically map these columns in the editor.

The supported formats are CSV and JSON files.

For more information, read the [CDC's official guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/wcms/4.0/cdc-wp/data-presentation/instructions/data-map-instructions.html) on formatting and to get example data files.
